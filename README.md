 # Steven's Tip calculator

In Steven's region, it is customary to leave a 15% tip for bills between $50 and $300, and a 20% tip for other amounts. The purpose of this project is to create a JavaScript based solution to calculate the tip amount based on the amount of the bill and to display the bill and tip amount along with the total cost.

## Tasks
- Determine a tip amount based on the bill using a ternary operator, store this result in a variable named `tip`.
- Create an output functionality to display a message in the console that includes the bill, tip, and total.
- Create a function names `calcTip` that accepts a bill amount as an input and calculates tip.
- Implement arrays for bills. tips, and totals.

## Test Data
- Data Set 1: Bill values of 275, 40, and 430
- Data Set 2: Bill values of 125, 555, and 44
